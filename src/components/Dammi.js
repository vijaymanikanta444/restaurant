        The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space
        between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating
        directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became
        standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common.
        The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original
        parágraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new
        group.[2] The Greek parágraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in
        English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline
        between sentences. The hedera leaf (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the
        same way. Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution In
        ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into paragraphs
        was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of
        the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes
        outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for
        example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting
        is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[3] Modern
        English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the
        first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States
        Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or
        other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph white space, or put in
        the indentation space. A second common modern English style is to use no
        indenting, but add vertical white space to create "block paragraphs." On
        a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a blank line for this
        purpose; professional typesetters (or word processing software) may put
        in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This style is very
        common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email.
        Wikipedia itself employs this format.
